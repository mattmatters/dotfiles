# dotfiles

Dotfiles are the most important part of anyone's configuration.  They are also quite spooky to newcomers.

My approach is to keep a repository and symlink (basically shortcut) the files into my home directory via GNU stow.



To install, you can either manually symlink the programs configurations you want, or you can run my install script which will symlink every file to the appropriate directory.
